 # Auto paths naming conventions

NodeX - X is the node to start the robot directly in front if; it will score the preload there.
xN - N is the amount of times the robot will try to score there.
Engage - The robot will attempt to engage at the end of the path.
Ready - Is ready to start the next cycle after auto ends (it will end close to the mid line)

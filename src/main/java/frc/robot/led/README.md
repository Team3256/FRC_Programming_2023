How to use the led (simple) API

In the LEDController: add custom length containers and add patterns

In Patterns: create custom patterns that extend from LEDPattern

Helpful to note that:

Patterns color percentage ranges, not pixel ranges
Everything is 0-indexed
follow the convention of BallColorPattern when creating patterns
